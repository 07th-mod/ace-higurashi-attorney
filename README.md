# Overview
'Ace Higurashi Attorney - The Curry Turnabout' is a Higurashi/Ace Attorney crossover fangame published by Misejimai-Sale, released at Winter Comiket 71 in 2006. Originally released under the name Gyakuten Higurashi Saiban, 16 years later this mod finally makes the game playable in English. The game was ported from nscripter to onscripter to suport the English translation. The original Japanese version is available for download on [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/Higurashisaiban).

A curry related crime has been committed, and Keiichi must fight to prove his innocence. This short game features the cast of Higurashi conducting a trial with gameplay straight out of Ace Attorney.

This game does not contain any spoilers for either work, so feel free to play even if you're only familiar with Higu or AA (or neither!).
